                    <h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                    <div class="first">
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a><span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</span></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a><span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The=assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</span></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Data Types</a><span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primities: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";  Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a><span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions fordifferent decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the folloiwng conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if thefirst condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</span></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Loops</a><span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!</span></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Function</a><span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a  list of instructions.  As an example we are putting  together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</span></li>
